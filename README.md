# CBT Habit Loop

App that allows employees of CBT Nuggets to create and track habits and gamify their progress against other employees.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

**Expo** for [IOS or Android](https://expo.io/)

**Expo CLI tools**
>You can install Expo CLI by running:

```

**iOS Simulator for Local Testing**

>The best way to test Habit Tracker locally is through the use of an iOS simulator, and XCode provides one with its software. XCode is available [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

**Android Emulator for Local Testing**

>[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) will allow you to set up an Android Emulator. Instructions for installing an emulator through Android Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd)

### Installing
